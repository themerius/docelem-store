# Change Log

We consider [SemVer](http://semver.org):

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
   manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

We would like to emphasize ยง4 SemVer:
Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development.
Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

And [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com):

- Each version should:
  - List its release date in the above format.
  - Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:
    - `Added` for new features. (+MINOR)
    - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality. (+MINOR or +MAJOR)
    - `Deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases. (+MINOR)
    - `Removed` for deprecated features removed in this release. (+MAJOR)
    - `Fixed` for any bug fixes. (+PATCH)
    - `Security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities. (+PATCH)
